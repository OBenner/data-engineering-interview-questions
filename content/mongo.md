## What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a document database built on a horizontal scale-out architecture that uses a flexible schema for storing data. Founded in 2007, MongoDB has a worldwide following in the developer community.

## Why use MongoDB?
As a document database, MongoDB makes it easy for developers to store structured or unstructured data. It uses a JSON-like format to store documents. This format directly maps to native objects in most modern programming languages, making it a natural choice for developers, as they donâ€™t need to think about normalizing data. MongoDB can also handle high volume and can scale both vertically or horizontally to accommodate large data loads.

## How does MongoDB exactly stores the data?

In MongoDB, records are stored as documents in compressed [BSON]([url](https://www.mongodb.com/json-and-bson)) files. The documents can be retrieved directly in JSON format, which has many benefits:

- It is a natural form to store data.
- It is human-readable.
- Structured and unstructured information can be stored in the same document.
- You can nest JSON to store complex data objects.
- JSON has a flexible and dynamic schema, so adding fields or leaving a field out is not a problem.
- Documents map to objects in most popular programming languages.

Most developers find it easy to work with JSON because it is a simple and powerful way to describe and store data.
