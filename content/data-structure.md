## What is data structure?
A data structure is a way of organizing data that considers not only the items stored, but also their relationship to each other. Advance knowledge about the relationship between data items allows designing of efficient algorithms for the manipulation of data.

[Table of Contents](#Data-Structures)

## What are the goals of data structure?
It must rich enough in structure to reflect the actual relationship of data in real world. The structure should be simple enough for efficient processing of data.

## What does abstract data type mean?
Data type is a collection of values and a set of operations on these values. Abstract data type refer to the mathematical concept that define the data type.
It is a useful tool for specifying the logical properties of a data type.
ADT consists of two parts
1) Values definition
2) Operation definition
   Example:-The value definition for the ADT RATIONAL states that RATIONAL value consists of two integers, second doesnt equal to zero.
   The operator definition for ADT RATIONAL includes the operation of creation (make rational) addition, multiplication and test for equality.

## What is the difference between a stack and an array?
STACK:
i) Stack is a ordered collection of items.
ii) Stack is a dynamic object whose size is constantly changing as items are pushed and popped.
iii) Stack may contain different data types.
iv) Stack is declared as a structure containing an array to hold the element of the stack, and an integer to indicate the current stack top within the array.
ARRAY:
i) Array is an ordered collection of items.
ii) Array is a static object i.e. no of item is fixed and is assigned by the declaration of the array.
iii) It contains same data types.
iv) Array can be home of a stack i.e. array can be declared large enough for maximum size of the stack.

[Table of Contents](#Data-Structures)

## What do you mean by recursive definition?
The definition which defines an object in terms of simpler cases of itself is called recursive definition.

[Table of Contents](#Data-Structures)

## What is sequential search?
In sequential search each item in the array is compared with the item being searched until a match occurs. It is applicable to a table organized either as an array or as a linked list.

[Table of Contents](#Data-Structures)

## What actions are performed when a function is called?
When a function is called
i) arguments are passed.
ii) local variables are allocated and initialized.
ii) transferring control to the function.

[Table of Contents](#Data-Structures)

## What actions are performed when a function returns?
i) Return address is retrieved.
ii) Functions data area is freed.
iii) Branch is taken to the return address.

[Table of Contents](#Data-Structures)

## What is a linked list?
A linked list is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes, where the linear order is given by pointers. Each node has two parts first part contain the information of the element second part contains the address of the next node in the list.

[Table of Contents](#Data-Structures)

## What are the advantages of linked list over array (static data structure)?
The disadvantages of array are:
i) unlike linked list it is expensive to insert and delete elements in the array.
ii) One cant double or triple the size of array as it occupies block of memory space.
In linked list
i) each element in list contains a field, called a link or pointer which contains the address of the next element.
ii) Successive elements need not occupy adjacent space in memory.

[Table of Contents](#Data-Structures)

## We apply binary search algorithm to a sorted linked list why?
No we cannot apply binary search algorithm to a sorted linked list, since there is no way of indexing the middle element in the list. This is the drawback in using linked list as a data structure.

[Table of Contents](#Data-Structures)

## What do you mean by free pool?
Pool is a list consisting of unused memory cells which has its own pointer.

[Table of Contents](#Data-Structures)

## What do you mean by garbage collection?
It is a technique in which the operating system periodically collects all the deleted space onto the free storage list.
It takes place when there is minimum amount of space left in storage list or when CPU is ideal.
The alternate method to this is to immediately reinsert the space into free storage list which is time consuming.

[Table of Contents](#Data-Structures)

## What do you mean by overflow and underflow?
When new data is to be inserted into the data structure but there is no available space i.e. free storage list is empty this situation is called overflow.
When we want to delete data from a data structure that is empty this situation is called underflow.

[Table of Contents](#Data-Structures)

## What are the disadvantages array implementations of linked list?
i) The no of nodes needed cant be predicted when the program is written.
ii) The no of nodes declared must remain allocated throughout its execution.

[Table of Contents](#Data-Structures)

## What is a queue?
A queue is an ordered collection of items from which items may be deleted at one end (front end) and items inserted at the other end (rear end).
It obeys FIFO rule there is no limit to the number of elements a queue contains.

[Table of Contents](#Data-Structures)

## What is a priority queue?
The priority queue is a data structure in which the intrinsic ordering of the elements (numeric or alphabetic)
Determines the result of its basic operation. It is of two types:
i) Ascending priority queue- Here smallest item can be removed (insertion is arbitrary).
ii) Descending priority queue- Here largest item can be removed (insertion is arbitrary).

[Table of Contents](#Data-Structures)

## What are the disadvantages of sequential storage?
i) Fixed amount of storage remains allocated to the data structure even if it contains less element.
ii) No more than fixed amount of storage is allocated causing overflow.

[Table of Contents](#Data-Structures)

## What are the disadvantages of representing a stack or queue by a linked list?
i) A node in a linked list (info and next field) occupies more storage than a corresponding element in an array.
ii) Additional time spent in managing the available list.

## What is dangling pointer and how to avoid it?
After a call to free(p) makes a subsequent reference to *p illegal, i.e. though the storage to p is freed but the value of p(address) remain unchanged .so the object at that address may be used as the value of *p (i.e. there is no way to detect the illegality).Here p is called dangling pointer.
To avoid this it is better to set p to NULL after executing free(p).The null pointer value doesnt reference a storage location it is a pointer that doesnt point to anything.

[Table of Contents](#Data-Structures)

## What are the disadvantages of linear list?
i) We cannot reach any of the nodes that precede node (p).
ii) If a list is traversed, the external pointer to the list must be persevered in order to reference the list again.

[Table of Contents](#Data-Structures)

## Define circular list?
In linear list the next field of the last node contain a null pointer, when a next field in the last node contain a pointer back to the first node it is called circular list.
Advantages – From any point in the list it is possible to reach at any other point.

[Table of Contents](#Data-Structures)

## What is linked list?
Linked List is one of the fundamental data structures. It consists of a sequence of ? nodes, each containing arbitrary data fields and one or two (”links”) pointing to the next and/or previous nodes. A linked list is a self-referential datatype because it contains a pointer or link to another data of the same type. Linked lists permit insertion and removal of nodes at any point in the list in constant time, but do not allow random access.

[Table of Contents](#Data-Structures)

## What does each entry in the link list called?
Each entry in a linked list is called a node. Think of a node as an entry that has three sub entries. One sub entry contains the data, which may be one attribute or many attributes. Another points to the previous node, and the last points to the next node. When you enter a new item on a linked list, you allocate the new node and then set the pointers to previous and next nodes.

[Table of Contents](#Data-Structures)

## What is impact of signed numbers on the memory?
Sign of the number is the first bit of the storage allocated for that number. So you get one bit less for storing the number. For example if you are storing an 8-bit number, without sign, the range is 0-255. If you decide to store sign you get 7 bits for the number plus one bit for the sign. So the range is -128 to +127.

## What do you mean by rehashing?
If the table gets too full, the running time for the operations will start taking too long and inserts might fail for open addressing with quadratic resolution. A solution to this is to build another table that is about twice as big with the associated new hash function and scan down the entire original hash table, computing the new hash value for each element and inserting it in the new table. This entire operation is called rehashing.

The cells h0(x), h1(x), h2(x),…. are tried in succession, where hi(x)=(Hash(x)+F(i))mod Tablesize with F(0)=0. The function F is the collision resolution strategy.

## Write the disadvantages of separate chaining?
The elements are evenly distributed. Some elements may have more elements and some may not have anything.
It requires pointers. This leads to slow the algorithm down a bit because of the time required to allocate new cells, and also essentially requires the implementation of a second data structure.

## Write the advantage of separate chaining?
Number of elements can be inserted as it uses linked lists.

[Table of Contents](#Data-Structures)

## What do you mean by separate chaining?
Separate chaining is a collision resolution technique to keep the list of all elements that hash to the same value. This is called separate chaining because each hash table element is a separate chain (linked list). Each linked list contains all the elements whose keys hash to the same index.

## What are the collision resolution methods?
Separate chaining or External hashing.
Open addressing or Closed hashing.

## What do you mean by collision in hashing?
When an element is inserted, it hashes to the same value as an already inserted element, and then it produces collision.

## Write the importance of hashing?
Maps key with the corresponding value using hash function.
Hash tables support the efficient addition of new entries and the time spent on searching for the required data is independent of the number of items stored.

## What do you mean by hash function?
A hash function is a key to address transformation which acts upon a given key to compute the relative position of the key in an array. The choice of hash function should be simple and it must distribute the data evenly. A simple hash function is hash_key=key mod tablesize.

[Table of Contents](#Data-Structures)

## What do you mean by hash table?
The hash table data structure is merely an array of some fixed size, containing the keys. A key is a string with an associated value. Each key is mapped into some number in the range 0 to tablesize-1 and placed in the appropriate cell.

[Table of Contents](#Data-Structures)

## Define hashing?
Hashing is the transformation of string of characters into a usually shorter fixed length value or key that represents the original string. Hashing is used to index and retrieve items in a database because it is faster to find the item using the short hashed key than to find it using the original value.

## What do you mean by the term percolate down?
When the minimum element is removed, a hole is created at the root. Since the heap now becomes one smaller, it follows that the last element X in the heap must move somewhere in the heap. If X can be placed in the hole, then we are done.. This is unlikely, so we slide the smaller of the holes children into the hole, thus pushing the hole down one level. We repeat this step until X can be placed in the hole. Thus, our action is to place X in its correct spot along a path from the root containing minimum children. This general strategy is known as percolate down.

[Table of Contents](#Data-Structures)

## What do you mean by the term percolate up?
To insert an element, we have to create a hole in the next available heap location. Inserting an element in the hole would sometimes violate the heap order property, so we have to slide down the parent into the hole. This strategy is continued until the correct location for the new element is found. This general strategy is known as a percolate up; the new element is percolated up the heap until the correct location is found.

## What is the need for priority queue?
In a multiuser environment, the operating system scheduler must decide which of the several processes to run only for a fixed period of time. One algorithm uses queue. Jobs are initially placed at the end of the queue. The scheduler will repeatedly take the first job on the queue, run it until either it finishes or its time limit is up and place it at the end of the queue if it does not finish. This strategy is not appropriate, because very short jobs will soon to take a long time because of the wait involved in the run.
Generally, it is important that short jobs finish as fast as possible, so these jobs should have precedence over jobs that have already been running. Further more, some jobs that are not short are still very important and should have precedence. This particular application seems to require a special kind of queue, known as priority queue. Priority queue is also called as Heap or Binary Heap.

## List the types of rotations available in splay tree?
Let us assume that the splay is performed at vertex v, whose parent and grandparent are p and g respectively. Then, the three rotations are named as:
Zig: If p is the root and v is the left child of p, then left-left rotation at p would suffice. This case always terminates the splay as v reaches the root after this rotation.
Zig-Zig: If p is not the root, p is the left child and v is also a left child, then a left-left rotation at g followed by a left-left rotation at p, brings v as an ancestor of g as well as p.
Zig-Zag: If p is not the root, p is the left child and v is a right child, perform a left-right rotation at g and bring v as an ancestor of p as well as g.

Right-Right: The newly inserted node is in the right subtree of the right child of A.
Left-Right: The newly inserted node is in the right subtree of the left child of A.
Right-Left: The newly inserted node is in the left subtree of the right child of A.

## What do you mean by balanced trees?
Balanced trees have the structure of binary trees and obey binary search tree properties. Apart from these properties, they have some special constraints, which differ from one data structure to another. However, these constraints are aimed only at reducing the height of the tree, because this factor determines the time complexity.
Eg: AVL trees, Splay trees.

## Why it is said that searching a node in a binary search tree is efficient than that of a simple binary tree?
In binary search tree, the nodes are arranged in such a way that the left node is having less data value than root node value and the right nodes are having larger value than that of root. Because of this while searching any node the value of the target node will be compared with the parent node and accordingly either left sub branch or right sub branch will be searched. So, one has to compare only particular branches. Thus searching becomes efficient.
