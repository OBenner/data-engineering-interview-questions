## Write sql query to get the second highest salary among all employees?
Given Employee Table with two columns
ID, Salary 10, 2000
11, 5000
12, 3000

[Table of Contents](#SQL)

## There are multiple ways to get the second highest salary among all employees.
Option 1: Use Subquery
SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee WHERE Salary NOT IN (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee );
In this approach, we are getting the maximum salary in a subquery and then excluding this from the rest of the resultset.
Option 2: Use Not equals
select MAX(Salary) from Employee WHERE Salary <> (select MAX(Salary) from Employee )
This is same as option 1 but we are using <> instead of NOT IN.

## How can we retrieve alternate records from a table in oracle?
We can use rownum and MOD function to retrieve the alternate records from a table.
To get Even number records:
SELECT * FROM (SELECT rownum, ID, Name FROM Employee) WHERE MOD(rownum,2)=0
To get Odd number records: SELECT * FROM (SELECT rownum, ID, Name FROM Employee)
WHERE MOD(rownum,2)=1

## Write sql query to find max salary and department name from each department.
Given Employee table with three columns
ID, Salary, DeptID
10, 1000, 2
20, 5000, 3
30, 3000, 2

Department table with two columns: ID, DeptName
1, Marketing
2, IT
3, Finance

This is a trick question. There can be some department without any employee. So we have to ask interviewer if they expect the name of such Department also in result.
If yes then we have to join Department table with Employee table by using foreign key DeptID. We have to use LEFT OUTER JOIN to print all the departments.
Query would be like as follows:
SELECT d.DeptName, MAX(e.Salary) FROM Department d LEFT OUTER JOIN Employee e ON e.DeptId = d.ID GROUP BY DeptName

## Write sql query to find records in table a that are not in table b without using not in operator.
Consider two tables
Table_A

10
20
30

Table_B
15
30
45
We can use MINUS operator in this case for Oracle and EXCEPT for SQL Server.
Query will be as follows:
SELECT * FROM Table_A MINUS SELECT * FROM Table_B

## What is the result of following query?
SELECT CASE WHEN null = null THEN "True" ELSE "False" END AS Result;
Answer: In SQL null can not be compared with itself. There fore null = null is not true. We can compare null with a non-null value to check whether a value is not null.
Therefore the result of above query is False.
The correct way to check for null is to use IS NULL clause.
Following query will give result True. SELECT CASE WHEN null IS NULL THEN "True" ELSE "False" END AS Result;

## Write sql query to find employees that have same name and email.
Employee table:
ID	NAME	EMAIL
10	John	jbaldwin
20	George	gadams
30	John	jsmith

This is a simple question with one trick. The trick here is to use Group by on two columns Name and Email.
Query would be as follows: SELECT name, email, COUNT(*) FROM Employee GROUP BY name, email HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

## Write sql query to find max salary from each department.
Given Employee table with three columns
ID, Salary, DeptID 10, 1000, 2
20, 5000, 3
30, 3000, 2

We can first use group by DeptID on Employee table and then get the Max salary from each Dept group.
SELECT	DeptID, MAX(salary) FROM Employee GROUP BY DeptID

## Write sql query to get the nth highest salary among all employees.
Given Employee Table with two columns
ID, Salary 10, 2000
11, 5000
12, 3000

Option 1: Use Subquery We can use following sub query approach for this:
SELECT * FROM Employee emp1 WHERE (N-1) = ( SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(emp2.salary)) FROM Employee emp2 WHERE emp2.salary > emp1.salary)
Option 2: Using Rownum in Oracle
SELECT * FROM (SELECT emp.*,row_number() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) rnum FROM Employee emp) WHERE rnum = n;

[Table of Contents](#SQL)

## How can you find 10 employees with odd number as employee id?
In Oracle we can use Top to limit the number of records. We can also use Rownum < 11 to get the only 10 or less number of records.To find the Odd number Employee ID, we can use % function.
Sample Query with TOP:
SELECT TOP 10 ID FROM Employee WHERE ID % 2 = 1;
Sample Query with ROWNUM:

## Write sql query to get the names of employees whose date of birth is between 01/01/1990 to 31/12/2000.
This SQL query appears a bit tricky. We can use BETWEEN clause to get all the employees whose date of birth lies between two given dates.
Query will be as follows:
SELECT EmpName FROM Employees WHERE birth_date BETWEEN "01/01/1990" AND "31/12/2000"
Remember BETWEEN is always inclusive of both the dates.

## Is it safe to use rowid to locate a record in oracle sql queries?
ROWID is the physical location of a row. We can do very fast lookup based on ROWID. In a transaction where we first search a few rows and then update them one by one, we can use ROWID. But ROWID of a record can change over time. If we rebuild a table a record can get a new ROWID. If a record is deleted, its ROWID can be given to another record. So it is not recommended to store and use ROWID in long term. It should be used in same transactions.

## What is a pseudo�olumn?
A Pseudocolumn is like a table column, but it is not stored in the same table. We can select from a Pseudocolumn, but we can not insert, update or delete on a Pseudocolumn. A Pseudocolumn is like a function with no arguments. Two most popular Pseudocolumns in Oracle are ROWID and ROWNUM. NEXTVAL and CURRVAL are also pseudo columns.

## What is the difference between delete and truncate in sql?
Main differences between DELETE and TRUNCATE commands are:
DML vs. DDL: DELETE is a Data Manipulation Language (DML) command. TRUNCATE is a Data Definition Language (DDL) command.

Number of Rows: We can use DELETE command to remove one or more rows from a table. TRUNCATE command will remove all the rows from a table.
WHERE clause: DELETE command provides support for WHERE clause that can be used to filter the data that we want to delete. TRUNCATE command can only delete all the rows. There is no WHERE clause in TRUNCATE command.
Commit: After DELETE command we have to issue COMMIT or ROLLBACK command to confirm our changes. After TRUNCATE command there is no need to run COMMIT. Changes done by TRUNCATE command can not be rolled back.

[Table of Contents](#SQL)

## What is the difference between ddl and dml commands in sql?
Main differences between Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands are:
+ DDL vs. DML: DDL statements are used for creating and defining the Database structure. DML statements are used for managing data within Database. Sample Statements: DDL statements are CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME etc. DML statements are SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, MERGE, CALL etc.
+ Number of Rows: DDL statements work on whole table. CREATE will a create a new table. DROP will remove the whole table. TRUNCATE will delete all records in a table. DML statements can work on one or more rows. INSERT can insert one or more rows. DELETE can remove one or more rows.
+ WHERE clause: DDL statements do not have a WHERE clause to filter the data. Most of DML statements support filtering the data by WHERE clause.
+ Commit: Changes done by a DDL statement can not be rolled back. So there is no need to issue a COMMIT or ROLLBACK command after DDL statement. We need to run COMMIT or ROLLBACK to confirm our changed after running a DML statement.
+ Transaction: Since each DDL statement is permanent, we can not run multiple DDL statements in a group like Transaction. DML statements can be run in a Transaction. Then we can COMMIT or ROLLBACK this group as a transaction. E.g. We can insert data in two tables and commit it together in a transaction.
+ Triggers: After DDL statements no triggers are fired. But after DML statements relevant triggers can be fired.

## Why do we use escape characters in sql queries?
In SQL, there are certain special characters and words that are reserved for special purpose. E.g. & is a reserved character. When we want to use these special characters in the context of our data, we have to use Escape characters to pass the message to database to interpret these as non Special / non Reserved characters.

## What is the difference between primary key and unique key in sql?
Main differences between Primary key and Unique key in SQL are:
+ Number: There can be only one Primary key in a table. There can be more than one Unique key in a table.
+ Null value: In some DBMS Primary key cannot be NULL. E.g. MySQL adds NOT NULL to Primary key. A Unique key can have null values.
+ Unique Identifier: Primary Key is a unique identifier of a record in database table. Unique key can be null and we may not be able to identify a record in a unique way by a unique key
+ Changes: It is not recommended to change a Primary key. A Unique key can be changed much easily.
+ Usage: Primary Key is used to identify a row in a table. A Unique key is used to prevent duplicate non-null values in a column.

## What is the difference between inner join and outer join in sql?
Let say we have two tables X and Y.
The result of an INNER JOIN of X and Y is X intersect. It is the INNER overlapping intersection part of a Venn diagram. The result of an OUTER JOIN of X and Y is X union Y. It is the OUTER parts of a Venn diagram. E.g. Consider following two tables, with just one column x and y:

x | y
- -|- -
  10 | 30
  20 | 40
  30 | 50
  40 | 60
  In above tables (10,20) are unique to table X, (30,40) are common, and (50,60) are unique to table Y.
  INNER JOIN An INNER JOIN by using following query will give the intersection of the two tables X and Y. The intersection is the common data between these tables.
  select * from X INNER JOIN Y on X.x =Y.y;
  x | y
  --+--
  30 | 30
  40 | 40

OUTER JOIN
A full OUTER JOIN by using following query will us the union of X and Y. It will have all the rows in X and all the rows in Y. If some row in X has not corresponding value in Y, then Y side will be null, and vice versa.
select * from X FULL OUTER JOIN Y on X.x = Y.y;

x| y
----- + -----
10 | null
20 | null

30 |	30
40 |	40
null |	60

## What is the difference between left outer join and right outer join?
Let say we have two tables X and Y.
The result of an LEFT OUTER JOIN of X and Y is all rows of X and common rows between X and Y.
The result of an RIGHT OUTER JOIN of X and Y is all rows of Y and common rows between X and Y.
E.g.
Consider following two tables, with just one column x and y:

x| y
- - -|- - 10 | 30
    20 | 40
    30 | 50
    40 | 60

In above tables (10,20) are unique to table X, (30,40) are common, and (50,60) are unique to table Y.
LEFT OUTER JOIN
A left OUTER JOIN by using following query will give us all rows in X and common rows in X and Y.
select * from X LEFT OUTER JOIN Y on X.x = Y.y;
x| y
-- -+-----
10 | null
20 | null
30 |30
40 |40
RIGHT OUTER JOIN
A right OUTER JOIN by using following query will give all rows in Y and common rows in X and Y.
select * from X RIGHT OUTER JOIN Y on X.x = Y.y;
x| y
----- +----
30	|	30
40	|	40
null	|	50

SELECT ID, Name FROM Employee WHERE name = "John"
We use having clause to filter the groups based on the values of aggregate functions.
E.g. We can group by department and only select departments that have more than 10 employees.
SELECT deptId, count(1) FROM Employee GROUP BY deptId HAVING count(*) > 10.

## What are the differences between heap table and temporary table in mysql?
+ Duration: Heap tables are stored in memory. Therefore a Heap table remains in existence even if the session is disconnected. When we restart Database, Heap tables get cleaned up.
+ Temporary tables are valid only during a session. Once the session is disconnected, temporary table is cleaned up.
+ Privilege: We need special privilege to create a Temporary table. Heap tables are just another form of storage in MySQL.
+ Sharing: Temporary tables are not shared between clients. Each connection will have a unique temporary table. But Heap tables can be shared between clients.

[Table of Contents](#SQL)

## What is a heap table in mysql?
In MySQL there are tables that are present in memory. These are called Heap tables. During table creation we specify TYPE as HEAP for HEAP tables.
Heap tables provide very fast access to data. We can not store BLOB or TEXT datatype in a HEAP table. These tables also do not support AUTO_INCREMENT. Once we restart the Database, data in HEAP tables is lost.

## What is the difference between blob and text data type in mysql?
BLOB is a Binary large Object. We can store a large amount of binary data in a BLOB data type column.
TEXT is non-binary, character based string data type. We can store text data in TEXT column. We have to define a character set with a TEXT column.
TEXT can be easily converted into plain text.
BLOB has four types: TINYBLOB, BLOB, MEDIUMBLOB and LONGBLOB.
Where as, TEXT has its own four types: TINYTEXT,TEXT, MEDIUMTEXT, LONGTEXT.

## What are the advantages of mysql as compared with oracle db?
Some of the main advantages of MySQL over Oracle DB are as follows:
+ Cost: MySQL is an Open Source and free RDBMS software. Oracle is usually a paid option for RDBMS.
+ Space: MySQL uses around 1 MB to run whereas Oracle may need as high as 128 MB to run the database server.
+ Flexibility: MySQL can be used to run a small website as well as very large scale systems. Oracle is generally used in medium to large scale systems.
+ Management: In MySQL, database administration is much easier due to self- management features like- automatic space expansion,
+ auto-restart and dynamic configuration changes. In Oracle dedicated DBA has to work on managing the Database.
+ Portable: MySQL is easily portable to different hardware and operating system. Migrating Oracle from one platform to another is a tougher task.

## What is the difference between char and varchar datatype in mysql?
Some main differences between CHAR and VARCHAR datatypes in MySQL are as follows:
+ Size: In CHAR type column, length is fixed. In a VARCHAR	type	column length can vary.
+ Storage: There are different mechanisms to store and retrieve CHAR and VARCHAR data types in MySQL.
+ Maximum Size: A CHAR data type can hold maximum 255 characters. A VARCHAR datatype can store up to 4000 characters.
+ Speed: CHAR datatype is 50% faster than VARCHAR datatype in MySQL.
+ Memory Allocation: A CHAR datatype column uses static memory allocation. Since the length of data stored in a VARCHAR can vary, this datatype uses dynamic memory allocation.

## What is the use of i am a dummy flag in mysql?
In MySQL, there is falg "ia_am_a_dummy" that can be used to save beginner developers from erroneous query like "DELETE FROM table_name". If we run this query it will delete all the data from table names table_name. With     "i_am_a_dummy      flag", MySQL will not permit running such a query. It will prompt user to create a query with WHERE clause so that only specific data is deleted. We can achieve similar functionality with "safe_updates" option in MySQL. This flag also works on UPDATE statement to restrict updates on a table without WHERE clause.

## What is automatic initialization and updating for timestamp in a mysql table?
In MySQL, there is a TIMESTAMP datatype that provides features like automatic initialization and updating to current time and date. If a column is auto-initialized, then it will be set to current timestamp on inserting a new row with no value for the column. If a column is auto-updated, then its value will be updated to current timestamp when the value of any other column in the same row is updated. We can mark a column as DEFAULT to prevent this auto- initialize and auto-update behavior.

## What is sharding in sql?
The process of breaking up large tables into smaller chunks (called shards) that are spread across multiple servers is called Sharding.
The advantage of Sharding is that since the sharded database is generally much smaller than the original; queries, maintenance, and all other tasks are much faster.

## What are transaction storage engines in mysql?
To be able to use MySQL"s transaction facility, you have to be using MySQL"s InnoDB storage engine (which is the default from version 5.5 onward). If you are not sure which version of MySQL your code will be running on, rather than assuming InnoDB is the default engine you can force its use when creating a table, as follows.

## What is ddl and dml and dcl?
If you look at the large variety of SQL commands, they can be divided into three large subgroups. Data Definition Language deals with database schemas and descriptions of how the data should reside in the database, therefore language statements like CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE belong to DDL. DML deals with data manipulation, and therefore includes most common SQL statements such SELECT, INSERT, etc. Data Control Language includes commands such as GRANT, and mostly concerns with rights, permissions and other controls of the database system.

## On executing delete statement i keep getting the error about foreign key constraint failing so what do i do?
What it means is that so of the data that you"re trying to delete is still alive in another table. Like if you have a table for universities and a table for students, which contains the ID of the university they go to, running a delete on a university table will fail if the students table still contains people enrolled at that university. Proper way to do it would be to delete the offending data first, and then delete the university in question. Quick way would involve running SET foreign_key_checks=0 before the DELETE command, and setting the parameter back to 1 after the DELETE is done. If your foreign key was formulated with ON DELETE CASCADE, the data in dependent tables will be removed automatically.

## Explain the difference between myisam static and myisam dynamic?
In MyISAM static all the fields have fixed width. The Dynamic MyISAM table would include fields such as TEXT, BLOB, etc. to accommodate the data types with various lengths. MyISAM Static would be easier to restore in case of corruption, since even though you might lose some data, you know exactly where to look for the beginning of the next record.

## What does myisamchk do?
It compressed the MyISAM tables, which reduces their disk usage.

[Table of Contents](#SQL)

## Explain advantages of innodb over myisam?
Row-level locking, transactions, foreign key constraints and crash recovery.

[Table of Contents](#SQL)

## Explain advantages of myisam over innodb?
Much more conservative approach to disk space management - each MyISAM table is stored in a separate file, which could be compressed then with myisamchk if needed. With InnoDB the tables are stored in tablespace, and not much further optimization is possible. All data except for TEXT and BLOB can occupy 8,000 bytes at most. No full text indexing is available for InnoDB. TRhe COUNT(*)s execute slower than in MyISAM due to tablespace complexity.

## General information about mysql.
MySQL is a very fast, multi-threaded, multi-user, and robust SQL (Structured Query Language) database server.

W## hy Sql Is A Database Management System?
A database is a structured collection of data. It may be anything from a simple shopping list to a picture gallery or the vast amounts of information in a corporate network. To add, access, and process data stored in a computer database, you need a database management system such as MySQL. Since computers are very good at handling large amounts of data, database management plays a central role in computing, as stand-alone utilities, or as parts of other applications.

[Table of Contents](#SQL)

## Why use mysql?
MySQL is very fast, reliable, and easy to use. If that is what you are looking for, you should give it a try. MySQL also has a very practical set of features developed in very close cooperation with our users. You can find a performance comparison of MySQL to some other database managers on our benchmark page. See section 12.7 Using Your Own Benchmarks. MySQL was originally developed to handle very large databases much faster than existing solutions and has been successfully used in highly demanding production environments for several years. Though under constant development, MySQL today offers a rich and very useful set of functions. The connectivity, speed, and security make MySQL highly suited for accessing databases on the Internet.

## How mysql optimizes distinct?
DISTINCT is converted to a GROUP BY on all columns, DISTINCT combined with ORDER BY will in many cases also need a temporary table.
When combining LIMIT # with DISTINCT, MySQL will stop as soon as it finds # unique rows.
If you don"t use columns from all used tables, MySQL will stop the scanning of the not used tables as soon as it has found the first match.
SELECT DISTINCT t1.a FROM t1,t2 where t1.a=t2.a;
In the case, assuming t1 is used before t2 (check with EXPLAIN), then MySQL will stop reading from t2 (for that particular row in t1) when the first row in t2 is found.

[Table of Contents](#SQL)

## How mysql optimizes limit?
In some cases MySQL will handle the query differently when you are using LIMIT # and not using HAVING:
+ If you are selecting only a few rows with LIMIT, MySQL will use indexes in some cases when it normally would prefer to do a full table scan.
+ If you use LIMIT # with ORDER BY, MySQL will end the sorting as soon as it has found the first # lines instead of sorting the whole table.
  When combining LIMIT # with DISTINCT, MySQL will stop as soon as it finds # unique rows.
  In some cases a GROUP BY can be resolved by reading the key in order (or do a sort on the key) and then calculate summaries until the key value changes. In this case LIMIT # will not calculate any unnecessary GROUP BY"s.
  As soon as MySQL has sent the first # rows to the client, it will abort the query.
  LIMIT 0 will always quickly return an empty set. This is useful to check the query and to get the column types of the result columns.
  The size of temporary tables uses the LIMIT # to calculate how much space is needed to resolve the query.

## Mysql speed of delete queries ?
If you want to delete all rows in the table, you should use TRUNCATE TABLE table_name. The time to delete a record is exactly proportional to the number of indexes. To delete records more quickly, you can increase the size of the index cache.

## Explain what is a view?
A view is like a subset of a table which is stored logically in a database. A view is a virtual table. It contains rows and columns similar to a real table. The fields in the view are fields from one or more real tables. Views do not contain data of their own. They are used to restrict access to the database or to hide data complexity.

SQL constraints are the set of rules that enforced some restriction while inserting, deleting or updating of data in the databases.

[Table of Contents](#SQL)

## What are the constraints available in sql?
Some constraints in SQL are : Primary Key, Foreign Key, Unique Key, SQL Not Null, Default, Check and Index constraint.

[Table of Contents](#SQL)

## What is a unique key and primary key and foreign key?
+ A UNIQUE KEY constraint is used to ensure that there are no duplication values in the field/column.
+ A PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a database table. All columns participating in a primary key constraint must not contain NULL values.
+ A FOREIGN KEY is a key used to link two tables together. A FOREIGN KEY in a table is linked with the PRIMARY KEY of another table.

[Table of Contents](#SQL)

## What is the difference between unique and primary key constraints?

PRIMARY KEY doesn"t allow NULL values whereas Unique key allows NULL values.

[Table of Contents](#SQL)

## What is a null value?
A field with a NULL value is a field with no value. A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation. Assume, there is a field in a table is optional and it is possible to insert a record without adding a value to the optional field then the field will be saved with a NULL value.

## What is normalization?
Normalization is the process of table design to minimize the data redundancy.
There are different types of Noramalization forms in SQL:-
+ First Normal Form (1NF): It removes all duplicate columns from the table. Creates table for related data and identifies unique column values
+ First Normal Form (2NF): Follows 1NF and creates and places data subsets in an individual table and defines relationship between tables using primary key
+ Third Normal Form (3NF): Follows 2NF and removes those columns which are not related through primary key
+ Fourth Normal Form (4NF): Follows 3NF and do not define multi-valued dependencies. 4NF also known as BCNF

## Explain the working of sql privileges?
SQL GRANT and REVOKE commands are used to implement privileges in SQL multiple user environments.  The administrator of the database can grant or revoke privileges to or from users of database object like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALL etc.
GRANT Command: This command is used provide database access to user apart from an administrator.
Syntax: GRANT privilege_name
ON object_name
TO {user_name|PUBLIC|role_name}
[WITH GRANT OPTION];
In above syntax WITH GRANT OPTIONS indicates that the user can grant the access to another user too.
REVOKE Command: This command is used provide database deny or remove access to database objects.
Syntax: REVOKE privilege_name
ON object_name
FROM {user_name|PUBLIC|role_name};

[Table of Contents](#SQL)

## How many types of privileges are available in sql?
There are two types of privileges used in SQL, such as
System Privilege: System privileges deal with an object of a particular type and specifies the right to perform one or more actions on it which include Admin allows a user to perform administrative tasks, ALTER ANY INDEX, ALTER ANY CACHE GROUP CREATE/ALTER/DELETE TABLE, CREATE/ALTER/DELETE VIEW etc.
Object Privilege: This allows to perform actions on an object or object of another user(s) viz. table, view, indexes etc. Some of the object privileges are EXECUTE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT, FLUSH, LOAD, INDEX, REFERENCES etc.

## What is blocking and how would you troubleshoot it?
Blocking occurs when two or more rows are locked by one SQL connection and a second connection to the SQL server requires a conflicting on lock on those rows. This results in the second connection to wait until the first lock is released.
Troubleshooting blocking:

SQL scripts can be written that constantly monitor the state of locking and blocking on SQL Server
The common blocking scenarios must be identified and resolved.
The scripts output must be checked constantly.
The SQL profilers data must be examined regularly to detect blocking.

## Explain the different types of backups available in sql server.
Complete database backup: This type of backup will backup all the information in the database. Used most commonly for disaster recovery and takes the longest time to backup.
Differential databse backup: The database is divided into partitions that have been modified since last complete backup. Most suitable for large databases. The most recent differential backup contains the changes from previous backups.
Transaction log backups: Backups only the changes logged in the transaction log. The transaction log has all changes logged about a database. Once the changes are accommodated on the database, the log is truncated or backed up.
File/File Group backups: used to recover individual files or file groups. Each filegroup can be individually backed up. This helps in recovery only the required file or filegroup for disaster recovery.

## Describe in brief databases and sql server databases architecture.
SQL Server consists of a set of various components which fulfill data storage and data analysis needs for enterprise applications. Database architecture: All the data is stored in databases which is organized into logical components visible to the end users. It"s only the administrator who needs to actually deal with the physical storage aspect of the databases, whereas users only deal with database tables.
Every SQL Server instance has primarily 4 system database i.e. master, model, tempdb and msdb. All other databases are user created databases as per their needs and requirements.
A single SQL Server instance is capable of handling thousands of users working on multiple databases.

+ Number of joins and use of complex views/cursors have to be reduced.
+ The use of the stored procedures and indexes have to be maximized.
+ The optimized use of the complex conditional checks and computer columns have to be in place.
+ Tracking of performance analysis for the query helps us in identifying the right aspects to optimize.

## How would you use the sp_ functions to identify the blocking problems?
Blocking is the deadlock situation when two SQL connections race to obtain the control over the same set of rows in conflicting terms. This can be tracked by the status of WAIT present in the SP_LOCK procedure"s output. All the active LOCKS and the different rows that are being involved are shown in this output. The identification of the connections involved in the specific row contention lock can be identified with sp_who and sp_who2 procedures. This way the causal agents of the blocking is identifies. KILL command issued against the specific SQL connection causing the BLOCK can resolve the issue. But the permanent solution lies in the proper design of the application code to execute in concurrence across different connections.

## What are the different types of backups?
The SQL server offers 4 types of backups to suit the need of the administrator.

+ Complete backup- The complete back up is just zipping the content of the entire database in terms of the different tables and procedures etc. This back up can server as an independent entity that can be restored in different systems with just the base SQL server installed.
+ Transaction log backup: This is the mechanism of backing up the transaction logs that have been maintained in the server. This way the details of the database getting updated is obtained. This cannot be a stand-alone back up mechanism. But can save a lot of time if we already have the file system related to the DB backed up on the new deployment server.
+ Differential backup: This is a subset of the complete backup, where only the modified datasets are backed up. This can save the time when we are just trying to maintain a backup server to main server.
+ File backup: This is the quickest way to take the backup of entire database. Instead of taking in the data actually stored in DB, the files are backed up and the file system thus obtained when combined with the transaction logs of the original system will render the database that we are trying to back up.

## What are the different levels of isolation?
The isolation represents the way of separating the database from the effects of network accesses, thereby maintaining the consistency. The different levels of isolation are:
+ read committed: This level of isolation uses the shared locks and the reads to the database give the constant and consistent values.
+ read uncommitted: No locks implemented. This is the least effective isolation level.
+ repeatable read: There are locks over the rows and values but the updates are maintained as a separate phantom row which is the next set of values for the specific record. Values can change within a specific transaction of a SQL function.
+ SERIALIZABLE reads: This is the implementation of pure lock mechanism where one specific transaction is not allowed access to specific record before another one completes.

## How can you know that statistics should be updated?
Statistics represent the uniqueness for the indexes that are being used for selecting the records. This can make the query execution pretty efficient. The tables that we are dealing with if truncated and repopulated, there is a good chance that the indexes and statistics are out of sync and this is when we have to update the statistics. There are also other situations like when the table has been modified and lot of rows have been added recently or like when a server has been updated with different version of software. These also give us the reason to use the UPDATE_STATISTICS, DBCC SHOW_STATISTICS etc to update it accordingly.

## What is a schema? how is it useful in sql servers?
The Schema refers to the overall structure of the database with all related information like users, access privileges, interaction information between the different tables etc. The CREATE SCHEMA is the command that can be used to create the schema in the SQL Server. This when done can be used to re deploy the same database in another system for demonstrative or test purposes. This holds intact the underlying framework over which the database has been built.

## What is write ahead log?
The write-ahead log is the logging system that just updates the buffer cache of the database for the transactions and updates the logs and only then the actual changes are incorporated in the actual database. This is the reason why it is called “write ahead”. This helps in maintaining the consistency in the database. This can also be useful in getting the actual database values even in case of failures.

## What are scrollable cursors? how are they created?
The scrollable cursors are the ones that can get the entire set of rows as single entity, within which all the rows present can be accessed in any order without the open/close of cursor done for every row access. The scrollable cursors are created with the keyword SCROLL added to the CREATE Cursor statements. The scrollable cursors are useful for the access of information from different rows but not for the delete/insert of new rows.

## What is raid and how does it help storage of databases?
The RAID stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks. With its own RAID controllers, the RAID implements a fail-safe storage mechanism with its own backup mechanisms. There are different configurations of the RAID that all give us the ACID properties of storage along with other such facilities. This kind of storage will make the SQL Server database to be failsafe and stable. This can sometimes mean that the backup mechanisms and other such reliability measures can be taken off from the SQL Server level of operations.

## How do you implement one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships while designing tables?
+ One-to-One relationship can be implemented as a single table and rarely as two tables with primary and foreign key relationships.
+ One-to-Many relationships are implemented by splitting the data into two tables with primary key and foreign key relationships.
+ Many-to-Many relationships are implemented using a junction table with the keys from both the tables forming the composite primary key of the junction table.

## What is the difference between a primary key and a unique key?
Both primary key and unique enforce uniqueness of the column on which they are defined. But by default primary key creates a clustered index on the column, where are unique creates a nonclustered index by default. Another major difference is that, primary key doesn"t allow NULLs, but unique key allows one NULL only.

## What are user defined datatypes and when you should go for them?
User defined datatypes let you extend the base SQL Server datatypes by providing a descriptive name, and format to the database. Take for example, in your database, there is a column called Flight_Num which appears in many tables. In all these tables it should be varchar(8). In this case you could create a user defined datatype called Flight_num_type of varchar(8) and use it across all your tables.

## Define candidate key and alternate key and composite key.
A candidate key is one that can identify each row of a table uniquely. Generally a candidate key becomes the primary key of the table. If the table has more than one candidate key, one of them will become the primary key, and the rest are called alternate keys.
A key formed by combining at least two or more columns is called composite key.

+ + Its Move group from cluster administration is possible for both side.
+ + System performance will go down, if both resources are in one node.
+ Active/Passive :
+ + Its also basically use for nodes But in this case Only one Active node with default instance. No system performance degradation will be there for this case even if we switchover to the other node. Both have same configuration.

## What is lock escalation?
Lock escalation is the process of converting a lot of low level locks (like row locks, page locks) into higher level locks (like table locks). Every lock is a memory structure too many locks would mean, more memory being occupied by locks. To prevent this from happening, SQL Server escalates the many fine-grain locks to fewer coarse-grain locks. Lock escalation threshold was definable in SQL Server 6.5, but from SQL Server 7.0 onwards it"s dynamically managed by SQL Server.

## What is the difference between delete table and truncate table commands?
DELETE TABLE is a logged operation, so the deletion of each row gets logged in the transaction log, which makes it slow. TRUNCATE TABLE also deletes all the rows in a table, but it won"t log the deletion of each row, instead it logs the deallocation of the data pages of the table, which makes it faster. Of course, TRUNCATE TABLE can be rolled back.

## What is an index and what are the types of indexes and how many clustered indexes can be created on a table?
Indexes in SQL Server are similar to the indexes in books. They help SQL Server retrieve the data quicker.
Indexes are of two types. Clustered indexes and non-clustered indexes. When you craete a clustered index on a table, all the rows in the table are stored in the order of the clustered index key. So, there can be only one clustered index per table. Non-clustered indexes have their own storage separate from the table data storage. Non-clustered indexes are stored as B-tree structures (so do clustered indexes), with the leaf level nodes having the index key and it"s row locater. The row located could be the RID or the Clustered index key, depending up on the absence or presence of clustered index on the table.
If you create an index on each column of a table, it improves the query performance, as the query optimizer can choose from all the existing indexes to come up with an efficient execution plan. At the same t ime, data modification operations (such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) will become slow, as every time data changes in the table, all the indexes need to be updated. Another disadvantage is that, indexes need disk space, the more indexes you have, more disk space is used.

## What are statistics under what circumstances they go out of date and how do you update them?
Statistics determine the selectivity of the indexes. If an indexed column has unique values then the selectivity of that index is more, as opposed to an index with non-unique values. Query optimizer uses these indexes in determining whether to choose an index or not while executing a query.
Some situations under which you should update statistics:

One can create and modify Oracle databases using the Oracle "dbca" (Database Configuration Assistant) utility. The dbca utility is located in the $ORACLE_HOME/bin directory. The Oracle Universal Installer (oui) normally starts it after installing the database server software. One can also create databases manually using scripts. This option, however, is falling out of fashion, as it is quite involved and error prone. Look at this example for creating and Oracle 9i database:
CONNECT SYS AS SYSDBA
ALTER SYSTEM SET DB_CREATE_FILE_DEST="/u01/oradata/";
ALTER SYSTEM SET DB_CREATE_ONLINE_LOG_DEST_1="/u02/oradata/";
ALTER SYSTEM SET DB_CREATE_ONLINE_LOG_DEST_2="/u03/oradata/";
CREATE DATABASE;

[Table of Contents](#SQL)

## What database block size should I use?
Oracle recommends that your database block size match, or be multiples of your operating system block size. One can use smaller block sizes, but the performance cost is significant. Your choice should depend on the type of application you are running. If you have many small transactions as with OLTP, use a smaller block size. With fewer but larger transactions, as with a DSS application, use a larger block size. If you are using a volume manager, consider your "operating system block size" to be 8K. This is because volume manager products use 8K blocks (and this is not configurable).

[Table of Contents](#SQL)

## What are roles?
Roles are named groups of related privileges that are granted to users or other roles.

[Table of Contents](#SQL)

## What are the uses of roles?

## What is the advantage of the library?
Libraries provide a convenient means of storing client-side program units and sharing them among multiple applications. Once you create a library, you can attach it to any other form, menu, or library modules. When you can call library program units from triggers menu items commands and user named routine, you write in the modules to which you have attach the library. When a library attaches another library, program units in the first library can reference program units in the attached library. Library support dynamic loading-that is library program units are loaded into an application only when needed. This can significantly reduce the run-time memory requirements of applications.
